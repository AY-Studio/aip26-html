A business that sells PI also must provide a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link on its internet homepage that links to a webpage that enables the consumer to opt out of the sale of his or her PI.</span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">A business is prohibited from selling the PI of a consumer the business knows is less than 16 years of age, unless (for a child between 13 and 16 years of age) the child has affirmatively authorized the sale or (for a child less than 13 years of age) the child’s parent or guardian has affirmatively authorized the sale.</span></p><p class="p22"><span class="s5"><b>G.</b></span><span class="s4">&nbsp;</span><span class="s6"><b>Privacy Policy Requirements.</b></span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">A covered business must include the following in its online privacy policy, which should be updated every 12 months:</span></p><p class="p36"><span class="s15">•</span><span class="s9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s4">A description of consumer CCPA rights, including the right to opt out of the sale of PI and a separate link to a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” internet webpage if the business sells PI;</span></p><p class="p44"><span class="s15">•</span><span class="s9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s4">The method(s) by which a CCPA request can be submitted; and</span></p><p class="p33"><span class="s15">•</span><span class="s9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="s4">A list of the categories of PI the business has collected, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months.</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p5"><span class="s5"><b>VII.</b></span><span class="s4">&nbsp;</span><span class="s6"><b>How Do I Make a CCPA Request?</b></span></p><p class="p13"><span class="s5"><b>A.</b></span><span class="s9">&nbsp;</span><span class="s4"><b>Instructions for Submitting a Request.</b></span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s4">If you are a California consumer and wish to make a CCPA request to AIP Capital LLC, you may submit your request using one of the following methods:</span></p><p class="p45"><span class="s13"><b>Fill out a Form on our Website: </b><a href="https://aipcapital.com/PrivacyRequests/"><span class="s10">https://aipcapital.com/PrivacyRequests/</span></a></span></p><p class="p7"><span class="s4"><b>Call us at: +1 203-487-8200</b></span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s4">We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days of receiving it. The confirmation will provide a ticket number for your request, information about how we will process and attempt to verify your request, and by when you should expect to receive a response.</span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s4">Note that we are only required to respond to your request to know – for access or data portability – two times in any 12-month period.</span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s4">We are required to keep records of your CCPA request for at least 24 months, including any assigned ticket number, the request date and nature of the request, the manner in which the request was made, the date and nature of our response, and the basis for the denial of the request if the request is denied in whole or in part.</span></p><p class="p13"><span class="s5"><b>B.</b></span><span class="s9">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="s4"><b>AIP Capital LLC Needs to Verify Your CCPA Request.</b></span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s4">We need to be reasonably sure that the person making the request regarding your PI is you, or a representative that you have authorized to make a request on your behalf.</span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">We cannot respond to your request or provide you with PI if we cannot verify your identity or your authority to make a request on behalf another person. Accordingly, at the time you submit your request, we will request that you provide us certain information, such as your full name, date of birth, and address, that will allow us to attempt to reasonably verify you are either the person about whom we collected PI or an authorized representative of that person.</span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">To the extent possible, we will not ask you for new PI to verify your request, but will instead attempt to use the verification data you provide to cross-check information available in existing records. If we are unable to verify your request without requesting new PI, we will delete that new information as soon as practical after processing your CCPA request, except as may be required to comply with the CCPA’s request record retention requirements.</span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">You are not required to create an account with us to verify your request. We will only use PI you provide for verification to attempt to verify your identify or your authority to make the request for another person.</span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">Please note that certain requests require different levels of verification, depending on the sensitivity of the information at issue. For example, if you request to know the specific pieces of information we hold, and not just the categories, we will require, in addition to matching data points, your submission of a written declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose PI is the subject of the request. In addition, certain pieces of information, such as a social security number, driver’s license number or other government-issued identification number, or financial account information, will not be disclosed in response to a CCPA request.</span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">If you wish to authorize someone else to act on your behalf, we must receive proof that this person is authorized to do so. Proof can be provided by a consumer verifying his/her own identity directly with us and then providing written authority for a designated person to act on the consumer’s behalf, or through receipt of a power of attorney or other legal document establishing authority, or proof of registration with the California Secretary of State as a representative authorized to act for another consumer. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</span></p><p class="p22"><span class="s5"><b>C.</b></span><span class="s4">&nbsp;</span><span class="s6"><b>Our Response to Your CCPA Request.</b></span></p><p class="p9"><span class="s4">Within 10 days of receipt of your CCPA request, we will provide an initial confirmation of receipt with an assigned ticket number by email or U.S. Mail.</span></p><p class="p6"><span class="s4">If you submit a Request to Delete, we must re-confirm your choice to delete the specified information after your request has been verified and before the data is deleted.</span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">AIP Capital LLC strives to provide a response to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt, regardless of the time it takes to verify the request. If we need additional time, we will inform you of the reason.</span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">We will send our response to your request by U.S. mail or email, at your option. Any information we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding receipt of your request.</span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">If we cannot respond to or comply with your Request to Know or Request to Delete, say because we cannot verify your identity or because an exception applies, we will explain our reasoning and decision in our response.</span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded, and we have informed you in writing of the reasoning behind a charge and its estimated cost. We will provide a cost estimate before completing your request if we determine that a charge is warranted.</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p46"><span class="s5"><b>VIII.</b></span><span class="s9">&nbsp;</span><span class="s4"><b>How Do I Contact AIP Capital Regarding Pending Requests?</b></span></p><p class="p12"><span class="s4">If you have any questions about a pending CCPA request, please contact us and provide your ticket number:</span></p><p class="p47"><span class="s4"><b>Call us at: </b>+1 203 487-8200</span></p><p class="p47"><span class="s4"><b>E-mail Us at: </b>legalnotices@aipcapital.com<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s3">&nbsp;</span></p>								</div>
